        <h2 class="header2">About me</h2>
        <p>My career started with the setup and implementation of CRM systems. After a couple of months, I realized that it's not enough just to understand the computer well. You need to be able to edit the source code.</p>
        <p>At first, my colleagues helped me, showed me where and what to fix. Then I realized I wanted to know more. But then my training had to be postponed, as I was promoted to Deputy General Director. Having been in this position for more than three years, I entered the department and now I can fully devote myself to studying really interesting things for me.</p> 
        <p>In general, may the force come with me on this difficult path.</p>
